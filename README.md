# Trivia API Vue Starter

This project shows how to use [The Trivia API](https://the-trivia-api.com) to build a quiz app using Vue.js. Do whatever you like with it - fork the repo, copy code snippets, lift the whole thing if you want.

To get going, run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`. This will run the app locally.
